# SimpleTTS

A lightweight Python library for text-to-speech synthesis that makes it easy to use and switch between different TTS models.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is under active development and APIs may change. Not recommended for production use yet.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Simple and intuitive API - get started in minutes
- ðŸ”„ No model lock-in - switch models with just a few lines of code
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on ease of use - a single API for all models
- ðŸ“¦ Minimal dependencies - one package for all models
- ðŸ”Œ Extensible architecture - easily add new models

## Installation

Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install simpletts
```

Or get the latest version from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fakerybakery/simpletts
```

## Quick Start

```python
from simpletts.models.xtts import XTTS
import soundfile as sf

tts = XTTS(device="auto")
# Note: XTTS is licensed under the CPML license which restricts commercial use.

array, sr = tts.synthesize("Hello, world!", ref="sample.wav")

sf.write("output.wav", array, sr)
```

## Supported Models

| Model | License | Description |
