A lightweight Python library for running TTS models with a unified API.

!!! warning

    This project is under active development and APIs may change. Not recommended for production use yet.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Simple and intuitive API - get started in minutes
- ðŸ”„ No model lock-in - switch models with just a few lines of code  
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on ease of use - a single API for all models
- ðŸ“¦ Minimal dependencies - one package for all models
- ðŸ”Œ Extensible architecture - easily add new models

## Installation

Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install simpletts
```

Or get the latest version from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fakerybakery/simpletts
```

## Quick Start (Simple API)

The [Simple API](simple.md) provides the easiest way to get started with SimpleTTS. With just a few lines of code, you can generate natural-sounding speech. The Simple API **should not be used in environments that require customization or voice cloning** - it's designed for quick and easy use cases.

## Python API

```python
from simpletts.models.xtts import XTTS
import soundfile as sf

tts = XTTS(device="auto")
# Note: XTTS is licensed under the CPML license which restricts commercial use.

array, sr = tts.synthesize("Hello, world!", ref="sample.wav")

sf.write("output.wav", array, sr)
```
